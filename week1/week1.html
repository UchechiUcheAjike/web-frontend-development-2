    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h1>Rewiring Your Brain for a Mobile First Experience</h1>
    <p>•	Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011</p>
    <p>•	People have their heads in their phones in the modern world no longer on their laptops. </p> 
    <p>•	Starting small, and scaling up helps things grow well. This makes things a lot better for both the developer and end users. </p>
    <p>•	Mobile phones won’t fad which is why it is recommended to do mobile first in all program developments.</p>
