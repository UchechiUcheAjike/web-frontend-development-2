    <h1>Week 10 Notes</h1>
    <h2>MDN Validating Forms</h2>
    <p>Client-side form validation, helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.</p>
    <p>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience.Validation is When you enter data,</p>
    <p>the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.</p>
    <h3>Two types of client-side validation</h3>
    <p>1. Built-in form validation- Uses HTML5 form validation features, in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but.</p>
    <p>it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation</p>
    <p>2. JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all</p>
    <h3>Using built-in form validation</h3>
    <p>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</p>
    <p>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)</p>
    <p>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</p>
    <p>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type</p>
    <p>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</p>
   
    <h2>MDN Using Fetch</h2>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses</p>
    <p>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings:</p>
    <p>To cause browsers to send a request with credentials included on both same-origin and cross-origin calls, add credentials: 'include' to</p>
    <p>the init object you pass to the fetch() method. Files can be uploaded using an HTML <input type="file" /> input element, FormData() and fetch().</p>
    <p>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor. </p>
    <p>Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are resolve. Fetch API support can be detected by checking for the existence of Headers, Request,</p>
    <p>Response or fetch() on the Window or Worker scope.</p>
