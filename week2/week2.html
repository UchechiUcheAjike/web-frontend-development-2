    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Programming Basics</h2>
    <p>It is vital that the naming convension of constants and variables, are meaningful and short</p>
    <p>parseInt() is a useful function that can be used to convert a string representation of a numerical</p>
    <p>value back into a number.For values that have not been assigned a value, undefine, is the value given to them.</p>
    <h2>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
    <p>An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array,write a pair of square brackets:</p>
    <p>Empty Arrays are called heroes. Each item in an array can be treated as variables</p>
    <p>You can add, remove, update arrays in any position.</p>
    <p>To use logic in programming the if, else, then statements are used. These help to manipulate data.</p>
    <p>The while and for loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code.</p>
    <p>The while loop continously runs the block of code while the condition is true.</p>
    <p>The for loop</p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small,</p>
    <p>self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.</p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>My biggest question is why are codes frustrating?</p>
    <p>Another question is why my javascript would not work. </p>
    <p>The instructor does not have to answer about my javascript, I will take my code to tutors that will look at them first !!!</p>
