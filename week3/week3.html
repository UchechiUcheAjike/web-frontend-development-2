    <h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Object methods, "this"</h2>
    <p>Objects are usually created to represent things of the real world, like users or even orders. </p>
    <p>To create an object, you have to declare a variable first and then create a function which you can</p>
    <p>assign to a property. These created functions are then called, to enable the function permorm the duty to was created for.</p>
    <p>Object Oriented programming is a huge science of its own. When codes are written using objects, then it is</p>
    <p>it is OOP, which is the acronym for object oriented prgramming</p>
    <p> Very often an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job</p>
    <p>To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.</p>
    
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects act as a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions.</p>
    <p>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method. An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping</p> 
    <p>all its properties and methods in curly braces {}. The properties of an object can be accessed by using the dot notation. </p>
    <p>To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same as invoking a function,</p>
    <p>so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:. We can loop through objects to find all or some of the objects</p>
    <p>We can add, remove, nest, objects by using the correct operators</p>

    <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with</p>
    <p>the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.</p>
    <p>The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure</p>
    <p>These are very import ways of getting elements: getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector and querySelectorAll</p>
    
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>Event listeners in Javascript are  are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. </p>
    <p>Instead of the program having to constantly check to see if an event has occurred, the event listener will let</p>
    <p>it know when the event happens, and the program can then respond appropriately</p>
    <p>Types of events are Mouse Events, Keyboard Events, Modifier Keys, Touch Events, Touch Event Properties</p>
    <p>An event listener can be removed using the removeEventListener() method.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>No questions for the week. Things are making sense.</p>
