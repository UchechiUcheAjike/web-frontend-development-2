    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>Forms are a very common way of interacting with a web page </p>
    <p>A lot of visitors and users of the web, make use forms every day.</p>
    <p>Some ways,forms can be used to interact with a JavaScript program 
    <p>include the following:</p>
    <p>Form controls:Forms are made up of a form element that contains form</p> 
    <p>controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons </p>
    <p>Accessing form elements: document.forms is a good way to return an HTML</p>
    <p>collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup </p>
    <p>Form properties and methods: form.submit() method will submit the form automatically,</p>
    <p>form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML</p>
    <p>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL</p> 
    <p>to be processed on the server</p>
    <p>Form events: Some exclusive eventsto forms are: focus event which occurs when an element is focused on</p>
    <p>input element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element (either by clicking or tapping</p> 
    <p>on it or navigating to it using the keyboard)</p>
    <p>Submitting a form: The submit event is one of the most important form events</p>
    <p>Retrieving and changing values from a form: Text input element objects have a value property that can be used</p> 
    <p>to retrieve the text inside the field</p>
    <p>Form controls: input, select, textarea,button are so other usful form controls</p>
    
    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>There are three main concepts in OOP:</p>
    <p>Encapsulation: In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making</p>
    <P>methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.</p> 
    <p>Polymorphism: In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to</p> 
    <P>override shared methods with a more specific implementation</p>
    <p>Inheritance:  In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties</p> 
    <P>and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
   

    <h2>Modern Javascript</h2>
    <p>Libraries: Advantages of using popular liberies include optimization, testing, online documentation and commuty ready to help.</p>
    <p>Modular JavaScript: A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other</p>
    <p>files and by other modules. </p>
    <p>MVC frameworks: Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time in server-side languages.</p> 
    <p>It’s a common way of designing software, and used by server-side frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django. In recent</p> 
    <p>years it has been used in JavaScript code to make it easier to organize large-scale web applications.</p>
    <p>Package managers: Package managers allow developers to download modules from a central repository. </p>
    

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>I find it interesting that programming languages are similar in concept, the difference is in the syntax</p>
    <p>The principles from this week and others I learned in my python classes and they are not foreign. Interesting stuff.</p>
    <p>No question for the week, they will come as I practice more in the course of time</p>
