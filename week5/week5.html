    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <h2>Errors, exceptions, and warnings </h2>
    <p>When something goes wrong in a program and error occurs</p>
    <p>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</p>
    <p>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</p>
    <p>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</p>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error</p>
    <p>When a method is called and it does not exist, an exception error occurs</p>
    <h2>The importance of testing and debugging</h2>
    <p>It is important that errors are found, not minding Javascript is a forgiving programming language.</p>
    <p>We do not want our code failing silently and making the errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.</p>
    <h2>Strict mode</h2>
    <p>strict mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.</p>
    <p>Using strict mode helps in clarity, and speed of programming as their are always improved ways of doing things.</p>
    <h2>Debugging in the browser</h2>
    <p>Bugs are issues in a code. Debugging is finding codes issues and making them go away.Breakpoints are a great way to debug codes</p>
    <p>Some good debugging methods include the use of alert method, and using the console.</p>
    <h2>Error objects</h2> 
    <p>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function</p>
    <p>Some error objects are: EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError</p>
    <h2>Throwing exceptions </h2>
    <p>Javascript can automatically throw error exceptions. Programmers can also throw their exceptions using the throw statement.</p>
    <p>This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background</p>
    <h2>Exception handling</h2>
    <p>When an exception occurs the program most of the time terminates which may seem like everything is broken.</p>
    <p>Exceptions can be handled better before everything crashes by catching the errors.</p>
    <h2>Testing frameworks</h2>
    <p>It is vital that programs are tested multiple times to make sure it meets the program requirement and it wont</p>
    <p>crash when the end users start making use of the product. Testing helps avoid tragedy of code which is why</p>
    <p>in the industry there are those it is their job to test and try to break programs.</p>


    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>Which is best, writing a debugging code first and tailoring our code to the debugging code to make sure it passes </p>
    <p>or programming all we want and then using the debugging techniques we know to make sure the program works and does not crash? </p>
