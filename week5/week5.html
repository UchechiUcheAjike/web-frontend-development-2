    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <h2>Errors, exceptions, and warnings </h2>
    <p>When something goes wrong in a program and error occurs</p>
    <p>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</p>
    <p>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</p>
    <p>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</p>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error</p>
    <p>When a method is called and it does not exist, an exception error occurs</p>
    <h2>The importance of testing and debugging</h2>
    <p>It is important that errors are found, not minding Javascript is a forgiving programming language.</p>
    <p>We do not want our code failing silently and making the errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.</p>
    <h2>Strict mode</h2>
    <p>strict mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.</p>
    <p>Using strict mode helps in clarity, and speed of programming as their are always improved ways of doing things.</p>

    <h2>Debugging in the browser</h2>

    <h2>Error objects</h2> 

    <h2>Throwing exceptions </h2>

    <h2>Exception handling</h2>

    <h2>Testing frameworks</h2>



    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>I find it interesting that programming languages are similar in concept, the difference is in the syntax</p>
    <p>The principles from this week and others I learned in my python classes and they are not foreign. Interesting stuff.</p>
    <p>No question for the week, they will come as I practice more in the course of time</p>
