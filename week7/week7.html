    <h1>Week 7 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Further Functions</h2>
    <p>Functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around in the same way as every other value</p>
    <p>Functions can have their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by other functions.</p>
    <p>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property</p>
    <p> IIFE is an anonymous function that,is invoked as soon as it is defined</p>
    <p>Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it is only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.</p>
    <p>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesnâ€™t interfere with any other part of the program.</p>
    <p>A function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself.</p>
    <p>This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</p>
    <p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both.</p>

    <h2>AJAX</h2>
    <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</p>
    <p>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client</p>
    <p>HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. </p>
    <p>We can also use Ajax to send information. This can be a variety of formats, but is usually a JSON string.</p>
