    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    <p>Transition is very important. Without a transition, an element being transformed would change abruptly from one state to another</p>
    <p>Transition helps to control the change, making the process smooth and gradual. Two properties are required for transition to take effect:</p>
    <p>1. transition-property - The transition-property specifies the CSS property where the transition will be applied</p>
    <p>2. transition-duration - The transition-duration property specifies the time span of the transition</p>
    <p>Some other optional transitions are:</p>
    <p>Transition timing - The transition-timing-function property allows you to define the speed of the transition over the duration.</p>
    <p>Transition delay - The transition-delay property allows you to specify when the transform will start.</p>
    <h2>Transforms</h2>
    <p>With the CSS transform property you can rotate, move, skew, and scale elements. </p>
    <p>Scale - The scale value allows you to increase or decrease the size of an element.</p>
    <p>Rotate - With the rotate value, the element rotates clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified number of degrees.</p>
    <p>Translate - The translate value moves an element left/right and up/down. </p>
    <p>Skew - With the skew value, the element skews (or tilts) one direction or the other based on the values given for the X and Y axes.</p>
    <p>Transform origin - It allows you to specify the location origin of the transform.</p>
    <p>Matrix - The matrix method allows you to combine the scale, skew, and translate properties into one using a coordinate system. </p>

    <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>With HTML5â€™s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. Canvas was first developed by Apple.</p>
    <p>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, but does not allow modification of already drawn shapes. A shape has to be re drawn if changes need to be made.</p>
    <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. </p>
    <p>If you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG is more appropriate.</p>
    <p>Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</p>
