    <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>
    <h2>The Window Object</h2>
    <p>In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web</p>
    <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the  </p>
    <p>browser and computer screen. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object. In a browser environment,</p>
    <p>the global object is the window object.This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object</p>
    <p>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser.</p>
    <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. Some of them are:</p>
    <p>The href property -  returns the full URL as a string</p>
    <p>The protocol property - returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.)</p>
    <p>The host property - returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</p>
    <p>The port property - returns a string describing the port number</p>
    <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</p>
    <p>The search property returns a string that starts with a '?' followed by the query string parameters. </p>
    <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a "#" followed by the fragment identifier. </p>
    <p>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. </p>
    <p></p>
   
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies</p>
    <p>but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. </p>
    <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. </p>
    <p>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript</p>
